# ADC-FLASH Microelectronics report

This document explains the development of the CAN-FLASH (ADC-FLASH) architecture
and the series of manipulations made in Cadence for the Microelectronics projects
at the Grenoble Institute of Technology (Phelma).

## TODO

- OTA Amplifier
- All the simulations
- Check the integrity of the document (syntax, grammar, phrases)
- Reformulation of the phrases
- EB part of the CAN-FLASH + theoretical demonstrations
- Decomposition of the Architecture into functional phases (for the EB and Comparators)
- Theoretical explanations for different parts
- Introduction, Conclusion, (Annexes, Glossaire).

## Notes
Everything in red means it still needs to be modified.
